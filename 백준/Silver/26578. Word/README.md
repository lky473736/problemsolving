### 문제 설명

<p>Word searches are hard. Luckily, you're a programmer, so you can just write a program to find the words! Fortunately, the word searches that you are doing are only looking for one word, and that word is "word". Write a program that finds the number of instances of the word "word" in a word search.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line will contain a single integer n that indicates the number of data sets that follow. Each data set will start with two integers, r c with r being the number of rows and c being the number of columns, respectively. The next r lines will contain c random letters, creating a word search grid.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output the number of times that the word "word" appears in the word search. The letters can be going in any direction, including backwards.</p>
